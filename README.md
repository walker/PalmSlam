![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/PalmSlam/blob/main/PALMSLAM.jpg)
# Introduction
PALMSLAM is a handheld lidar mapping scanner device that is compatible with 5 common lidars: EAI X3 Pro, EAI T-mini plus, SLAM C1, Oradar MS200, EAI 4ROS. These 5 lidars have different prices and performances. Users can choose the lidar configuration that suits them according to their own usage environment or project requirements. PALMSLAM comes with a expansion board that integrates an ESP32 processor and a 6-axis IMU sensor. The lidar data is transmitted to the host device through microROS wireless communication technology to view the mapping effect in real time. 6-axis IMU monitors the holding posture in real time to ensure that PALMSLAM remains horizontal during mapping and obtains more accurate data. Compared with traditional mapping on computer or vehicle-mounted lidar mapping solutions, PALMSLAM is more flexible, portable, and easy to operate. It is an ideal choice for fast and accurate mapping.
